# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs for individuals based on demographic and health-related factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, number of children, and region. Using machine learning techniques, the model aims to estimate insurance charges, helping both insurance companies and individuals make informed financial decisions.

🎯 Project Goals

✔ Build a robust machine learning model that predicts individual medical charges.
✔ Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
✔ Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between features and insurance cost.
✔ Evaluate multiple ML algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree.
✔ Optimize model performance using techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
